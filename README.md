## Hi, I'm Liz 👋

I'm a developer relations engineer currently working on Fin projects at Intercom. So things like..
- 🔧 Helping partner developers [build integrations](https://developers.intercom.com/docs/webhooks/integrate-intercom-with-slack)
- ✨ Shiny new tooling like [MCP servers](https://developers.intercom.com/docs/guides/mcp)
- 💻 Updating our REST APIs and SDKs so that building on Intercom is, dare we say it, enjoyable

I used to work at [Evervault](https://evervault.com/) and before that I worked at [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/).

These are a few things I had fun working on:

📹 Book Bot - [Gift of reading](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZidaiiS24g)

📹 Encryption [Conference Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-pXi165Uok) where I made Tinder Profiles for Encryption Algorithms
